9tAvpJVbD-Z9to-U5yetJG,2023-08-24T17:32:40Z,Acid Wizard,@Fuzzy Tech Thanks for the explanation. I have my radiator on top and just assumed that was the best way to do it since hot air will naturally rise through the top and away from the radiator even without fans. Radiator on top mean fresh cool air is being pulled in unabated from the front and then expelled out the top after the GPU and or CPU heat it.

9tAvpJVbD-Z9tnQgwLx5V-,2023-08-24T12:11:14Z,Fuzzy Tech,"Not a huge difference but if you put it on the front where the air is normally drawn in then you would be pulling fresh, cooler outside air directly through the radiator where as on top, the warmer PC air is being pushed through the radiator. Keep in mind though there usually isn't a huge difference in temp, maybe two or three degrees in most cases. It mostly comes down to how you want to mount it as long as the pump isn't the highest part of the loop (don't want the air bubbles to collect around the pump).",Reply,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCawOzTZhmjvtGlbD0fN94DA,UCtoUbbzaELfQUt7WwBZsrQg,2023-08-24T12:11:14Z,UgxJ4liiKoAgU0GugdJ4AaABAg,Acid Wizard,,0

Had a B550 with a 3600, then, when the 5800X dropped to $200, I got that, and now I'm good for another 2 years. Then, I'll get a mid-range AM5, and 2-3 years later, get the high-end last-gen AM5 CPU, which will carry me another 3 years from purchase. 

With Intel, I'm pretty much stuck with replacing the MOBO every time I upgrade, because I don't upgrade every year. 

Considering that the initial  build price is almost identical, and the performance as well... Why the hell choose Intel? I'll take a 2% initial performance hit for a $200 saved in the MOBO, and easier upgrade (just update bios and drop a CPU in vs build almost the entire system all over again).",Thread,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoZBY6wHY-1JL2287q3uCsA,UCoZBY6wHY-1JL2287q3uCsA,2023-02-23T14:01:38Z,,,,0

So their performance in terms of latency is the same, right?
And what’s about single/dual rank vs memory channel count and how the heck do I find out if a module is of which rank kind? From my experience you can’t tell by the informations given on most spec sheets …

I see this is all tech videos, which I explained to Steve at #GamersNexus. You cannot conclude that CPU 1 (e.g., AMD) is 10% faster than CPU 2 (e.g., Intel) without testing many different units of the identical model. You absolutely need replication to conclude one is faster than the other because of variation among CPUs of the same model. This is where the term ""silicon lottery"" comes into play. Overclockers know this, which is why no two same CPUs will overclock the same. There should be error bars on all graphs with performance comparisons so we know what the margin of error is.

I am not meaning to be too critical here, but comparing a cpu or gpu vs. another even in machines with identical specifications is not scientifically correct. Why? Because this requires replication, a fundamental of any science experiment. For example, the minimum comparison would ideally have 4 computers/test machines (more is better, but cost prohibitive) with identical specs, with two having the same cpu/gpu being tested vs. two that have the have the same cpu/gpu reference. Why? Because we know that individual cpus/gpus vary in their performance. I'm a senior data scientist,  which is why I am pointing this out.

UgyJLeHA4yHp8ysucZp4AaABAg,2023-01-12T11:51:54Z,Hadley S.,I went with the AM5 7950x and Asus ROG Crosshair x670e Hero for future upgradability. AMD plans to support AM5 to at least 2025. Intel’s 14th gen will most likely be an entirely different platform and won’t be compatible with its currently 12th/13th gen motherboards. This is the only reason I went with AMD. That and I’ve had a lot of good experiences with the AM4 platform and being able to upgrade the CPUs easily with just BIOS updates.,Thread,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCapMmtkAuEEsaiJNu7KU-hw,UCapMmtkAuEEsaiJNu7KU-hw,2023-01-12T11:51:54Z,,,,2
9kmbQEFZGV59ptcZRQKqwY,2023-05-19T11:53:32Z,Hadley S.,@GeneralMikey🍔 want to know what’s funny. I ended up buying and building a 13900ks cpu and Asus ROG Maximus Z790 APEX motherboard with G.Skill 48GB 8000mhz CL40 kit overclocked to 8200mhz @ CL36. I love being able to overclock my cpu and ram and wring out more performance. CPU-Z says I’m up to 9% faster in single threaded work and 8% faster in multithreaded work compared to a regular 13900k. This would put me a head of the latest 7950x3D and 7800x3D CPUs in most games.,Reply,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCapMmtkAuEEsaiJNu7KU-hw,UCapMmtkAuEEsaiJNu7KU-hw,2023-05-19T11:55:23Z,UgyJLeHA4yHp8ysucZp4AaABAg,Hadley S.,GeneralMikey🍔,0

I am sticking with the AMD Ryzen 9 Ryzen 7 and one Ryzen 3 with DDR4 Ram setups for ten years so this is it. They should have come out with DDR5 sooner but too bad for them I am DRY now.
I went with the RED Team over the Blue for simplicity and price. Sorry Intel MB's and CPUs are just too much for the absolute negligible increase in FPS that with a simple video card you can fix well was a no brainer.  
Intel and the MB's that you need are far more expensive and have been for 20 years PLUS!

Went through three FX-8350 CPUs and got tired of RMA'ing for a new CPU, so I decided to go Intel on my next build. I went from a disappointing AMD FX Bulldozer line-up to an Intel i9-9900K and never looked back. Until Intel gives me a real reason to move away from their products back to AMD, I'll stick with Intel. None of my Intel builds have ever let me down, and that was starting with their Core 2 Quad Q6600. That CPU outlasted the motherboard and power supply.

As games were requiring better hardware, I upgraded and went with a AMD cpu... All those games I had been playing went crazy, and i just thought it was the older game engines could not keep up with the new hardware.  A few weeks ago me and one of the people I used lan party with were talking and as I still had the original game from back then on my back up drive, i copied it over and fired it up....To say my jaw hit the floor is an under statement, as it played perfectly fine on this new computer. I just upgraded to this system earlier this year and the primary difference is that I bought an intel cpu that people were raving about as the best budget cpu at the time (i5-11400f) and I also have a rx6700xt vc.  Not even the person I was talking with can play it with the same version of windows as me (10 pro) no one else can play it as they all have AMD cpus. The last time I tried it was when I upgraded from a geforce 750ti to a rx570 on my old fx-8350 system and it still went nuts. I am speaking about a few games from back then that play fine now, but the game we played on a lan is the original unreal tournament",Thread,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpW2NiR-Cqe_txkTVuuBs1A,UCpW2NiR-Cqe_txkTVuuBs1A,2022-12-08T08:51:58Z,,,,0

Ugwt7CESCGDiCmVEPYB4AaABAg,2022-12-06T22:43:45Z,Thewaterspirit57,"I honestly highly doubt the 5090 will come out within that 2 or 3 year time frame in 2024 or 2025. Cuz then That would assume it would take the same power draw as a 4090 (being 450 watts like the 3090) but the thing would be 30-50% more powerful than the 4090.
Nvidia was able to give the 4090 more shading cores, L2 cache, ray tracing cores, and tensor cores…. But it was only able to take that “supposedly” little power with that big of specs, because it’s 4nm compared to the 30 series being 8nm. I dunno if a different companies manufacturing process is different, and has different power draws…. But who knows.
I’d say the 5090 should be a 450/500 watt card, based on the full AD102 (but 2nm maybe), with more so a architecture refresh to give it more power. Because the architecture does determine how well the power of the gpu is, along with drivers.
We also have yet to see AMDs 7000 series, and if they deliver that “twice the performance” promise, but only having slight adjustments to the core/RT core count on the top end card. Especially as most of the power from the RX6950XT came from the fact it had much higher boost clocks compared to the 30 series, along with amd finally delivering better drivers for their GPUs.",Thread,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrEuNW0qr2rX8XnFyKoookQ,UCrEuNW0qr2rX8XnFyKoookQ,2022-12-06T22:43:45Z,,,,0

9jJMsxrQlRo9kMq1BEORE2,2023-01-02T02:20:03Z,Patriot 03,"I swear the entire PC enthusiast community doesn't understand ""CPU/GPU bottlenecks"" - The 2 work in tandem all the time, even when the GPU is maxed out improved latency by way of a faster CPU WILL result in higher performance.

The ms latency difference will be a constant but FPS is an imperfect way of measuring performance because a 1 ms difference when you were already running 500 FPS will result in a massive FPS difference, usually when we're running 4K and maxing a GPU out the latency is so high from that demanding workload that the starting latency is much higher meaning your FPS is lower, in that scenario the difference of 1 ms in terms of FPS becomes much smaller but it's always there.

Tech channels really need to set the misnomer right and this video at least did it indirectly as you saw a moderate performance delta at 4k maxing both GPUs.

PS: Think about it in terms of percentage, if you were already running at 4ms per frame a difference of 2ms would literally DOUBLE your FPS, but if you're running 42ms, going down to 40ms isn't going to represent a massive percentage to framerate - but 2ms is always 2ms and being 2ms faster is always a win. IMO testing games at unrealistic framerates to exaggerate the percent performance difference is dishonest and not relevant to anyone. They do it to show more impressive graphs. What I really want to see is CPU demanding games like RTS and Open World RPGs not a shooter with almost no logic for the CPU to handle running at 720p 1000 FPS.",Reply,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKSlrCi1RBKqTXMVb-N5Wyw,UCoLL5vlu201vRfqnyWzebZg,2023-01-02T02:26:45Z,UgzkoU71R6CqGowxXzJ4AaABAg,AtotehZ,,0

But the main thing gamers nexus found in his video after lots of testing was the only mode of failure was from improper insertion. But the connector can appear inserted and not be and with a tight angle slowly pull out of the conntector. It seems a design flaw that the sense pins are so long and allow the connector to still drive power when its pulled way out of the card.,Reply,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnJW89ck8xZR6FKxgLezS1g,UCZlS8A9qeL_yAtja-WKVkHg,2022-12-06T08:28:27Z,UgwE4QfH-7g5DB5oIwp4AaABAg,ragtop63,,0
9j9xU4RKVlm9jGrH0plwNH,2022-12-05T22:04:07Z,Rusty Shackleford,"probably difficult to do at that angle and pin density, without making it very large. You also have different points for failure such as the inner corner where there are two 'parallel' 90'd pins nested together with insulation between. Thats a strain point where the plastic (generally also performing insulation duties as a direct support) could be strained due to tugging and cause potential shorts.

Also, if the connector is too bulky, its could basically results in still being unable to close the case without strain.

Engineers have already started designing one (I believe cable-mod for sure), its just that ideas are worthless without execution, and that safety testing is super rigorous, especially after a widespread fire investigation on the original part.",Reply,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjsK2VvQOKRzT9WWtXi3RjQ,UCZlS8A9qeL_yAtja-WKVkHg,2022-12-05T22:04:07Z,UgwE4QfH-7g5DB5oIwp4AaABAg,ragtop63,,0

Stuff that catches there eye or sounds exciting . But most def after the architecture or world and people and all the polygons are rendered up which mainly relys on CPUs everything else is enhancing the graphics or adding more texcture or lighting effects etc that mainly relies on the gpu it is weired tho a game in 720 or 4 k will get the relativily same fps ( give or take a few ) when you have the same gpu and start swapping cpus at high end atleast. even at high end almost every GPU thats a step above the one you currently have makes a noticable difference when swapped out while running same cpu.,Reply,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAAFNcVXc9YxWM06_lqGc6g,UC2tUUTtTvjXcaYVPvgRQoXA,2023-04-24T09:00:28Z,UgwQg-3P5qvd85AgVap4AaABAg,MrMonotone,HazeyBlazey,0

Basically every professional CPU comparison test is done on low resolutions to actually test the CPUs. Often at 720p even. At 4k you could even run a 5800x3d or something and it would probably get the same FPS as those cpus. At 4k it's pretty much only your GPU that's working its ass off.

UgyRNmvrPI_6L_tDrAx4AaABAg,2022-11-30T15:29:59Z,Charles Hines,I don't mind LGA processors but I know if I ever install one be very careful NOT to damage that socket!  You don't even want your clothing to come in contact with it and get snagged on the delicate pins.  For that reason I would wear short sleeve shirt for it even in winter (just for the time it takes to get the chip safely in the socket).  I would also follow the CPU instructions to the letter for the LGAs.  It is not like the old ZIF sockets that you just open the socket and if the arrows are lined up it will just fall into place.  The ZIF sockets if the installation is done properly takes NO pressure on the chip.  In fact if you have to push on it you have the wrong chip or bent pins.  You might have also not lined it up correctly but if it does not go in under its own weight DO NOT try to force it or push it.  Then you will very likely damage either the socket or the CPU pins or both.  I know pins can be straightened but that would be really difficult and I would just prefer to avoid getting into that situation.  They are so close together on the AM4 chips you might find it challenging not to accidentally damage more pins straightening that one bent one.  Also keep in mind we don't know which pins we need so don't just break the offending pin off.  It may be one of the more critical ones.,Thread,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSDIEyskNAnbMoQCs7csLqQ,UCSDIEyskNAnbMoQCs7csLqQ,2022-11-30T15:29:59Z,,,,0

UgxaWDwvXMfbrSCQKqh4AaABAg,2022-11-28T15:41:27Z,wilson sorrentini,AMD wins due to Temps and Power consumption. And I really don't understand why AMD does not uses their better ratio of power to performance to sell more chips. Intel will always be a 5 to10% more powerful but at a 15% or more power consumption. You only saving a little but with todays prices that's an avg of $20 to $40 a year at normal use for 8 hrs a day. That gap increases drastically the more hrs you use it. So the chip pays for itself way sooner with AMD.,Thread,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUUeHp-8XjEZqiWfFqnRf-Q,UCUUeHp-8XjEZqiWfFqnRf-Q,2022-11-28T15:41:27Z,,,,0

Intel will likely be making a new platform for the 14000 series while AMD just kicked off AM5. I'm not forgetting what happened with threadripper, but they literally killed the product line. So while the platform didn't last, there aren't new cpus either. Also AMD is running cooler, drawing (somewhat) less power, and the price is close. It's still a no brainer for AMD even if AMD is more expensive. You can literally calculate by hand how much the added power draw will cost you per year.

They did a similar tactic with AM4 releasing only the top cpu's for the first year and then releasing more the year after. It's not a prediction it's just how they release new cpu's. It also says nothing about longevity. It's just showing they're releasing the rest of the first series.

But since it's AMD and they want your money more than Intel they're going to make sure you stay in their eco system for as long as possible.

You can overclock both the CPU and the ram and there is a lot of headroom on them because of motherboard manufacturer settings. In the case of AMD a delid would decrease temperature by a stupid amount and even sanding down the IHS can drop 10C. In the end Intel would have higher memory clocks but AMD could have tighter timings at lower clocks depending on the dies.,Thread,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaS0I7Hc4w_-S9WUSnMC26A,UCaS0I7Hc4w_-S9WUSnMC26A,2022-11-24T15:06:36Z,,,,0

9ioGGEXvo699iqpH10NwJg,2022-11-25T10:07:08Z,MatthewYTAccount,Honestly it's really similar.  AMD at least can also be scaled down to 105W or 65W easily if you so choose.  And I'd be surprised if Intel doesn't have something similar.  Both are past the efficiency portion of the curve in out of the box tuning.  Ignoring the TDP numbers the real world power draw being reported is within shrugging difference.  At 30 W or so difference you can make that up by using 1 less light bulb or upgrading to a high efficiency bulb.  Power efficiency is leaning towards a configuration option with how tuning tools are evolving.,Reply,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHp5a24jgNRp507ZE_ybPvg,UCYAQLjsjPwtI1bXTF5DAgwg,2022-11-25T10:07:08Z,UgzuPRCvsXfw60kDMiZ4AaABAg,Frederico Macias,,0

I saw this video in my recommended 2 hours after it released, and it was titled something close to “Intel VS AMD, who will win?” Or something close to that. Now it’s titled “I bought 2 of the FASTEST CPUs, and will only keep the winner”. 

It’s not like, earth shattering or anything like that, or “bad” really, but it just makes me wonder why. Is it just for the algorithm? Or that you guys think of a better title after the fact? I’ve noticed this with many different YouTubers, mostly of the ‘bright color thumbnail and all caps titles’ type. (Not saying clickbait because you do deliver on the content promised, but very eye-catching). Just something I’ve been curious about.

Intel on the other hand u really need to check carefully their motherboard, because some mid-tier motherboard doesnt even have a gen 5 nvme slot which is kind of disappointing. 

remember gen 5 nvme will come out eventually so it woud be great to have for future proof.

The good thing about intel, is their CPU, A LOT OF CORES meaning an i5 or i7 is more thank enough for anyone at all so easy for you to do multitasking.

If you want to see something messed up go to Walmart or wherever they sell electric heaters and almost every single one no matter what they claim for heat output btu if you read the specs they will be rated at 1500 watts so next time you go to buy a electric heater by the cheapest one with best fan able to move the hot air cause they all heat coils to the max 😂. Also why most vacuums rated near or at 1500 watts and why you may pop breakers let’s say near a kitchen when using vacuum because fridge etc appliances load with vacuum is over 2000 watts or 20 amps. But this is why breakers are 20 amps on standard 120v circuits.

Intel pros: more threads,  normally cheaper outside of sales, ddr4 still a option for other users 
Intel cons: 13900k is as good as you will get (apart from the probably ludicrous priced 13900ks coming next year.  14th gen is a new socket next year (probably ddr5 only too) and such things should be considered,  especially if you have the budget to get new cpus later 
Amd pros: more performance cores, more upgrade options with x3d on the horizon (which is probably going to blast the 13900k next year for gaming), better long term socket support 
Amd cons: initial price outside of sales, ddr5 only,  first gen teething trouble potentially. 

Overall I think with the two systems as shown I'd go amd as you don't need to buy any 10gb nic , which if you don't already have one eats whatever difference in cost exists anyway. Having the option to go 7950x3d (if it occurs of course,  might only go to 7800x3d) is a nice thing to have and being able to get zen5 and zen 6 chips and maybe even zen7 if it launches in 2025 is no bad thing imo either, especially as the extra am5 headroom allows amd to go beyond 16c/32t at some point (they were rumoured to have tested a 24c chip for 7000, but went with 16 possibly for thermal reasons).",Thread,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCDd3zOPtpE_DwJHilDOq0g,UCCDd3zOPtpE_DwJHilDOq0g,2022-11-24T03:52:44Z,,,,0
9in_cstcx2T9irHubh0YD8,2022-11-25T14:26:05Z,D827 Kelly,"@Luminatrix FanFiction Exactly. In the Enterprise arena the Milan-X chips are monsters, and the recent Genoa Epyc chips are 96C monsters as well, with Genoa-X to follow (-X meaning they have vCache). These are the reasons they developed the vCache, as for certain enterprise level applications they make a HUGE difference, such as for a formula 1 team doing aerodynamic airflow modelling (they sponsor Mercedes, so I'd be surprised if Mercedes don't use Milan-X to their advantage) and other such specialised uses. 

Like with games, programs have to really be programmed to take advantage of the extra cache so the results can be hit or miss. With more optimisation over time, the improvements could be even better, especially if the productivity applications adapt to better use it (currently the weak point for the 5800X3D chips).",Reply,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCDd3zOPtpE_DwJHilDOq0g,UCCDd3zOPtpE_DwJHilDOq0g,2022-11-25T14:26:05Z,UgwYxjDf7TliNlRsg6V4AaABAg,D827 Kelly,Luminatrix FanFiction,1

For example, look at Halo. AMD is about 2 ms frame rates faster which is important for smooth gameplay where the game isn't looking choppy or stuttery, especially if you are using a high refresh rate monitor. So despite it being 3-5 fps marginally behind in some titles, it looks like AMD is the winner. This isn't even an 3D -cache infinity version of the cpu, so the potential is enormous.",Reply,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8pYFNqpnhpRFdCUwin0xEA,UCCDd3zOPtpE_DwJHilDOq0g,2022-11-25T12:57:56Z,UgwYxjDf7TliNlRsg6V4AaABAg,D827 Kelly,,0

If your cooling is subpar, your room is too warm (and the CPU will heat it up more), you’ll end up with less performance. Add to that the power consumption is just bad for the environment. 

If you want a quality efficient CPU, get the 8 core AMD model or lower. The lower end Intel CPUs are better in this regard, but they just don’t offer the same performance as AMD.

Last thing to note is that not all performance is equal. If you play on VR, threaded latency matters and AMD is better for that.",Thread,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjvMDGoYc1Zm99Uz81pBs0g,UCjvMDGoYc1Zm99Uz81pBs0g,2022-11-24T02:37:53Z,,,,2

No one likes to watching a single car on a drag strip... Having both side by side is much more awesome, much more fun.
So...
Please build identical drag racing rigs for testing things...
Say, a pair of Intel Rigs, and a pair of AMD rigs...
Each paired with identical components... down to the mouse and keyboard...
Then when you're testing, say, 2 new GPUs, you have them side by side! Or SSDs, or RAM, or monitors, or mice, or mobos, or whatever!  Just swap out just those components out, so we can compare the new vs. old, or the competing brands, side by side.
You could even do the same as here, amd vs intel testing other stuff...  Or a 4 way!
You've kinda done similar things before...  I just think it'd be awesome to have identical apart from the test components drag race machines becoming a regular thing.

It's just nice seeing an actual race.

AMD's AM5 is likely to be around for another 3 years (maybe 5 if we get lucky). But Intel's LGA1700 for the 13th gen, is probably the *last* generation we'll see of this socket. So if you buy a 13900K -- that's it, there is no further upgrade path for your system with that motherboard. With AMD you could buy a board now and in 5-6 years when you retire the system to some other task (file server, home theater pc, or whatever), you can buy a cheap CPU and get a little more power out of the motherboard.",Thread,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH3qcZ69StRIU5bou7G2Y6w,UCH3qcZ69StRIU5bou7G2Y6w,2022-11-23T23:54:13Z,,,,1

Conversely, the Maximus Z790 Extreme (not the Hero that Linus was building on) has a DIMM.2 slot. Same purpose except that it's two PCIe 4.0 slots instead of one being 5.0, and is about the same size as a RAM slot (hence the DIMM in the name).

Number of PCIE lanes might be important for a power user like Linus. Quality of RAM testing and support from Intel vs AMD. Processor encode/decode support/performance. Power consumption and heat. In the end, either choice is REALLY good right now, but also both are stupid expensive.

Simple because of the +3mm thick heatspreader. Yeah Linus wont care about the cooling and yeah the AMDs sucking little less watt in full load but I dont really want to buy a big ass watercooler just to still run over 90 degree as soon as you aply any load and the most load I probably have in davinci for about 5min or less on those chips. On top you need to tune your fans perfectly because the AMD core temperatures are moving a lot faster when the load changes a lot and noone wants the fans to go brrrr BBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRR brrr BBBBBRRRRRRRRR.......... I like aircooling and I know to cool an 13900k long term with air is basicaly not possible but I would still be able to get more time on higher clocks with Intel. AMD on the other side instantly getting over 100 cutting the clocks down. The same or even worse behavior you get with the smaller ones. Try aircooling an 7700x against an 13600k, the 13600k might be a bit more greedy from the wall but beats the 7700x nearly everywhere so just undervolt and underclock it on the 7700x performance level and you will get this thing easy cool and quiet with an aircooler+paste below 70 euro. Sorry AMD i like you but this gen is (till now) a clear win for Intel.

And as it's a brand new socket type and this is basically the first generation CPU on it, any upgrades I might do down the line (and that's a big if) will likely be ""significant"". 

But I'm honestly of the opinion that ""significant"" in this case is basically saying the same that ""the 1000C fire got significantly hotter, now at 1050C"" it IS hotter. 50C is no joke, if your room suddenly went 50C in either direction, you'd be VERY uncomfortable until you die. Sooner rather then later. But in context of 1000C? Not that big of a difference unless it's for a very special application.

9imgdPKELU49imiqb_fOpm,2022-11-23T19:54:00Z,Daily Corvid,"13700k is not great for multithreaded heavy processing (unless you can get the work done during the CPU boost period).  This is because one side of the CPU heats up too much so the whole chip has to throttle.  I think GamersNexus proved that this is caused by their LGA slot device to hold the CPU down, it doesn't distribute the pressure equally and so you get one side too much one side not enough...

Your going to then see half your thermal paste get crushed too tight and not release heat, then the other side has no pressure and doesn't touch the CPU so no heat at all draws there.  So that's why unless you spend extra on a bracket then swap out the Intel one it's gonna lead to throttling and slow you down.  You will regret going with Intel there.

Probably best off with either 12900k, it's a wee bit more price wise but you can easily get a 30% discount in most places.  For the workload your comment suggests, it's the 12900k since it's far less likely to throttle down and overheat yet it performs almost equally to the 13700k and has the same igpu so you also get your encode/decode functions.

If you aren't happy spending that much on previous generation kit, then the obvious answer is to switch to an AMD system which offers equal performance or perhaps a tiny bit more - for far less money.  Add to this the upgrade options and you're gonna spend way way less that way.

But like I said, if you are an Intel guy you will kick yourself if you don't get the 12900k instead!  But you won't know until you've had it a year.

Best of luck bro.",Reply,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM8PAo7MO0pWFwsHMscRRtA,UCOK_6p3tLafdJcai4bC1o5g,2022-11-23T19:54:00Z,UgzVXUwtwOJ5RLWfYZt4AaABAg,Chris Holzer,,0

If you built a flagship level computer with a flagship level CPU, your next logical, substantial upgrade will not be the CPU.  More likely than not it will be the GPU.  The next thing or in parallel is usually better, faster, bigger internal and external storage.  So the typical fact that with AMD the socket remains the same for several years is at best irrelevant and at worst a hindrance.  From Z390 to Z790, PCI Express went from 3.0 to 5.0.  USB went from 10Gbps to 40Gbps (TB4).  Wi-fi 5 to 6E.  BT 5 to 5.3.  DDR4 to DDR5.  More and better M.2 options.  With AMD you could perhaps upgrade to the latest CPU without needing a new motherboard, say, 3-4 years later, but everything else stays stuck in the past.  I would not want an RTX 4090 on a Z390 motherboard.  Not saying it will cut its performance in half or anything like that.  But if I am buying an RTX 4090 its because I want the best possible performance out of it, and that is not going to happen on PCI-E 3.0.  BTW, between the i9-9900K (Z390) and the Ryzen 9 7950X (on the latest MB for it), you are looking at maybe 35% more CPU performance.  Not very impressive for a CPU that came out nearly 4 years later for 33% higher price (launch prices).",Reply,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6dm7rQI6GJWxa51Cgk3Kgw,UC6dm7rQI6GJWxa51Cgk3Kgw,2023-01-02T12:50:52Z,UgzP-HwHiDAQd_RHuEJ4AaABAg,Alex Zhang,,24

Long ago they used to mean the feature size or drain-source distance  of a transistor. With advent of FinFET these numbers are a hypothetical comparison to what if we could have transistors with such feature sizes, then how the performance would have scaled. Intel measures their process dimension different from TSMC and thus you can't quite make the old comparison hold true. 
Now about chip design. The front end HDL code for the chipsets must be highly optimised for what they are intended for but as some here mentioned they were made for similar features and so it really boils down to the compilers and simulation and verification softwares how good those are and how much the devs innovated and what decisions they made. But again you only have thus much die area and this much power target so when it comes to layout, place and route there is remarkably very little room for creativity.

Couldn't justify to upgrade the last 3 years while performance was still very good. And every performance vs price or heat/power consumption... I passed.

9jGHO4VSAn99liT0pKBQoF,2023-02-04T17:44:13Z,Jason Chen,"@poseidon3032 now you are thinking like a system engineer. The issue is that performance is overall performance at user side. At OS level, we can only predict (look ahead) so many instructions to set at the correct performance level. Hence, for gaming specifically, every single (serious) gamer would want to run at the max performance and sacrifice quality. Only some casual gamer would run perf and quality mode. Also depends on the games. 

Another thing is how human eyes work. Where we look directly, our eye's refresh rate is slow, so 30-60fps would be enough, However, human peripheral vision can be 90fps+. So the 144hz actually justifies when you are playing fps games and do make a different in terms of feel (try it).",Reply,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZe_wc3POhBC_CjfSb_czNQ,UCZe_wc3POhBC_CjfSb_czNQ,2023-02-04T17:44:13Z,UgxSE4P4ScGgW5Lxy754AaABAg,Jason Chen,poseidon3032,3

I think it's plain to see that it's not a huge increase in electricity bill, so it probably doesn't matter much. However, that's not really my reason. The thermal solutions for GPUs these days are getting absolutely insane, and the CPUs look like they'll follow. I don't know what kind of generational improvements we think we're making if ultimately we're just adding more transistors, die area, and the power consumption that comes with it. Ultimately, if the performance is the same between the platforms, but one takes 20% less power for the same performance, I'm going with that one because I can spend less on cooling, power supply, and even air conditioning. Pragmatically, it probably doesn't matter, but I think efficiency is an aesthetic choice that I gravitate to. My ideal computer is also physically small, and the greatest challenge with that is always cooling these days. I don't want to have to jump up a whole case size just because I need a 3 x 120 mm radiator instead of a 2 x 120 mm. It's a preference, sure, but it's also my money so... 🤷‍♂

Also, you gotta think, 100 extra watts across an entire consumer market is nothing to scoff at. We should probably be rewarding an efficient product over just a performant product with energy being such a big deal these days, if that's something you choose to value.",Reply,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsznE88YYiXEQPIkbmRhjvw,UCsznE88YYiXEQPIkbmRhjvw,2022-12-07T01:19:36Z,UgxAx-_9KHsGHZM51Xl4AaABAg,Birger Hedman,,2

The extra 100$ is for the CPU use time, not per month. Also I don't intent to buy a new CPU/year. Knowing what you are up to for the next 3-5years, is a good mind-set thinking.
To make your mind rest, the electricity cost on my country is around 0.10-0.12$/kwh (depending on regions, and if it's business or house).

But for the longer time I am just doing 2D or 3D that does not require that much rendering. If anything, if I see those coming in more frequently, and IF (and is a big IF) my renderings really require using CPU-only in Blender (ie, due to using physics that can't be rendered in GPU in that app or whatever) , then, til I change to AM5, I might consider a 5950X , due to having the best efficiency (electricity cost per frame), low power consumption yet being a very fast PC, very fast in single core apps and Photoshop.  And surely hitting nice prices soon. That or just getting a full system with a 7700X. But I am not finding yet any project for which the 3900X has a problem. Threadrippers are pricey, and the older generations were just as fast in Photoshop and other ""few cores"" apps as the mainstream basic CPUs, for that. More modern Threadrippers are super expensive.

Even in the higher end, where 7000s have gone more power hungry than in past AMD generations, to compete with Intel, AMD still has more efficiency per watt, in every test I've seen. Which ends up being important for specially ppl like me 3D rendering many hours (as that uses _a ton_ more energy than games) , but in this time and moment, even eu gamers, too. That said... dunno, undervolting in BIOs, or using certain apps, and even touching windows energy settings, limiting  the watts go a very long way in reducing energy costs (with both brands!) while not reducing too much performance, if done well. 

The funny aspect of it all is that most users (even freelancers in  pro work, I should now) do need way less computing than these CPUs are offering today. To the point where I can work without lags neither time out with a 13600K or a 7700X in all pro apps. Those two are IMO beyond enough for any freelancing (and gaming) activity. As much, I'd go for a 7900X or a 13700K (trying to config the bios system to use way less power than default, both systems!). Unless doing extremely intense highend work, 13900K and 7950X can be a bit of an overkill.  And I don't want to use 300W non stop many hours while rendering only in the CPU (that's around the waste with both brands in top rendering stuff, AMD a bit better. While a Ryzen 9 5950x uses a lot less power)  or rendering all day (with GPUs in rendering software happens about the same, but they 3D render  A LOT faster in GPU, so it can be quite more efficient).  If I were to use _always_ the CPU full day for 3D rendering, indeed I'd use my AM4 system (3900X, currently) with a 5950X. That one wins ALL the other CPUs (including zen 4 and Raptor Lake) in terms of efficiency, even while it's slower than the latest top end ones of both brands. 

But guess what, many pros are just using a custom made 2 cpu builds, using a pair of 5950X, or small render farms with those (due to its efficiency), to simply get even faster times than with a single 7950X. Bigger render farms I guess they'll go with cheaper cpus, as they always did.  5950X is really well designed, consumes very little power for what it achieves, and unlike other similar cpus previous to it, it has a very nice single core performance (thx to IPC, etc). Best ratio of rendered frame per watt, no matter the  (unbiased) review and benchmarks that I checked. But if you have top paying customers that require most of all speed in delivering... well, then I guess you'll just use a render farm service. Or, in some cases, build a God like machine for your own to get such crazy delivery times.  But there is a very ignorant misconception of some, that every GOOD  3D/2D pro graphic freelance artist  earns tons of money after expenses, and ""should"" afford a Ferrari-like PC or Mac. Nah, not to talk about myself, but I've know many amazing artists and graphic specialists, having worked at great companies, that don't go overboard with the station purchase, and aren't swimming in money, despite being top aces.

Thing is, if having already an AM4 system, if for games, I'd go for just swapping  the CPU with a 5800X3D. And for work a 5950X. Prices will settle down, cheaper mobos will appear in the future, for these two brands' new gens. It's still much cheaper than buying an entire new system and those are extremely good solutions, and about the most energy efficient (5800X3D uses less energy than even a 5800X, is pretty frugal, too). And if having an alder lake based system, you can do a good deal, too: No need to change the DDR4 RAM yet, and a 13600k / 13700k are phenomenal (I'd touch the bios and many energy settings, tho, even more so the case than with AMD).

Also PCIE5.0 and DDR5 are here to stay for a long time, so I don't see the motherboard becoming a problem anytime soon either, as long as AMD continues their previous trend of supporting new CPUs on older motherboards with a simple BIOS update.

My concern with Intel today is LGA1700s longevity, given their socket support trends. It's almost 2023 and LGA1851 is expected to drop late-23/early-24. So in a way we have the same idea. Why would anyone upgrade to that today if it's soon to be outdated.

9ioJC_8ARsf9ipODCXBzOs,2022-11-24T20:42:43Z,Niosus,"@RiceCube Tech Why are you so triggered by this? What I said is true, isn't it? They have ditched a socket before because it was more convenient to them, and they even did so twice, just recently. Sure, it wasn't on their mainstream platform, but it did happen on their high-end desktop platform.

Threadripper was high end, but certainly marketed more towards the consumer side than the business side. And this is very obvious in the branding as well. You have the regular Threadripper platform, alongside the Threadripper Pro platform (which is again another socket). Those are meant to go into workstations bought in bulk by companies.

And AMD absolutely did promise future support for sTRX4. I can't post a link here, but this is a direct quote from AMD. Feel free to Google if you don't believe me: ""sTRX4 sets us up nicely for future development and scalability of the Threadripper platform, both on a near- and long-term basis.""

Why AMD killed of Threadripper really doesn't matter. They made that statement by 3rd gen. They knew the market by then. I'm not even saying that they were wrong to kill consumer Threadripper (because again, Threadripper Pro is still very much alive and well). But they did make a strong statement indicating support. And they broke that promise. Which is why I'm saying: buy what's best for you now. I don't know anyone who has actually upgraded their CPU but kept their motherboard, you likely won't do it either. And even if you want to, there may be other reasons why you want/need to swap your motherboard anyway. Future-proofing is a fool's errand. Sometimes you may save some money, but often you're just spending more for a capability you'll never use.",Reply,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-l1JtKggpOTZjY8w6DGPZg,UC-l1JtKggpOTZjY8w6DGPZg,2022-11-24T20:42:43Z,UgzNj6uFAS6gdF8V9BJ4AaABAg,TangoMikeOscar,RiceCube Tech,1

Right now Intel with 13th gen have done a great job (thank you AMD) and provide a lot more on the productivity side as those e cores are actually very good, thus forcing AMD to drop prices as they cannot compete product to product on price so the 13600K gives the 7600X a good going over and even keeps up with the 7700X, the 13700K with the 7900X. Remember AMD put their prices up across the board as soon as they became competitive and now it is Intel that is cheaper...who would have thought! competition can only be a good thing and right now there is really no bad choice as both AMD and Intel have stellar CPU's and hopefully they keep knocking lumps out of each other.....I hope the new AMD GPU's in the 7900X and XTX give Nvidia a bloody nose as we so badly need competition in the GPU space.

TR4 only lasted for 1st and 2nd gen Threadripper, while sTRX4 was only compatible with 3rd gen.

Now i don't think they'll abandon AM5 before 2025, but note that that's barely more than a 2 year commitment given the platform launched late 2022. They're not actually promising that much. If they release another generation early 2024 and break compatibility with the next in early 2026, they're technically not breaking their promise.

9inFshoAGCA9kpr44nSKsC,2023-01-13T18:06:24Z,Juzu Juzu,"@Corey DRIZZLE 12900K vs. 5950X, using 2 hours work 100% work, 2 hours for gaming, and you'll end up using 200KWh more electricity per one year. So if you upgrade once in 3 years you have used 600KWh which costs here 50% of the price of these CPUs. To get similar ratio with Lambo, even if you drive insane amounts it would have to use like 20-50 litres per one kilometer. So at that point the cost would certainly be a factor.

For some reasons techtubers talk about everything except the price of electricity, and that's stupid. The problem is that you would have to create graphs with total cost of ownership based on the amount of usage, and price of electricity. Still I would hope the biggest tech tuber to start that trend, because otherwise we get these idiotic situations like with Zen 4 where you can cut 50% of the used electricity and get 1-5% reduction of performance depending on the workload. And they kind of have to do this because people only focus on the performance and not on TCO.",Reply,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS32NPcN7TmUPbrRSYp6geQ,UCS32NPcN7TmUPbrRSYp6geQ,2023-01-13T18:06:24Z,Ugz8kSmHAiL5fBrBl1Z4AaABAg,vgtrombone,Corey DRIZZLE,1

As with these CPUs there's really no point on going with Intel unless you either don't use your computer more than occasionally or play certain specific games competitively where Intel is faster. The cost of electricity over the course of ownership will be more than the price difference by far, if you do any work.  And if you don't do any work, you get even faster gaming with 7700X that is much much cheaper.

I really would like to see TCO calculations with these tests, perhaps that could change the course we are heading with this industry. It's insane to release CPUs with 300W power usage where you get over 80% of the performance with less than 100W.",Reply,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS32NPcN7TmUPbrRSYp6geQ,UCS32NPcN7TmUPbrRSYp6geQ,2023-01-13T17:51:10Z,Ugz8kSmHAiL5fBrBl1Z4AaABAg,vgtrombone,,0

IE: He just needed to explain why he knew about the PC, not identify all of its owners, to get the point across.
Following that: He needed to use ""The PC"" as a noun, and to differentiate it from any other ""PC"", so he would then need to reference the owners of ""The PC"", who happened to be the family of the Gf.

However,  there have been some issues with delays for the process it is supposed to use as well as problems with the architecture itself (mostly effecting the server sapphire rapid chips though). 

However it is possible Intel could repeat 11th gen and port the 14th gen to the 12th/13th gen process. Though the other rumours are that 14th gen cuts the core count back down compared with 12th and 13th gen chips. We're still a year away and a lot could depend on what amd does with x3d chips as to whether Intel feels like changing its current road map for 14th and 15th gen. 

Either way they're not going to give more than 14th gen if at all in comparison to potential of 4 generations on am5 by 2025, maybe more.",Reply,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCDd3zOPtpE_DwJHilDOq0g,UCCDd3zOPtpE_DwJHilDOq0g,2022-11-24T04:00:57Z,UgzZw_2lBix45HibfNh4AaABAg,Ryaninja,Tissue Oflies,0

More importantly, the difference in power consumption would only be a fraction of that again.
They're both consuming pretty grotesque amounts though.

Ironically, I think it probably makes more difference at the bottom to middle end, due to lower initial cost and higher power consumption differences between CPUs. Albeit the power used would be much lower either way.
I suspect they could've largely got very similar performance in games with 'slower'/cheaper/lower power consumption CPUs(maybe 4-6 very fast cores) anyway.

Again, I’m a optimist on technology and think we will keep breaking what we think are the limits. But, it is foolish to believe it is inevitable that we will keep advancing in the face of potential hard physical laws, as nothing about the world is for sure, and even more so that we can predict the future rate of advancement off of a relatively short trend such as semiconductor improvements for the past few decades. This discussion started on the premise that we will see similar improvements over the next few generations as what was seen say for AM4 from AMD (baring massive increases in power utilizations). I think most people who actually work in the field agree this is unlikely, at least in the era we are in (during which AM5 will exist). Perhaps in a 5, 10, 20 years we will be back to a rapid race of advancement  and decreasing costs. The one thing we can solidly take from the history of technology is that it is highly unpredictable. Things people expect to advance often doesn’t, and new areas advance beyond what people even imagined possible.",Reply,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX90IoNadx0F6EgGmW71hug,UCX90IoNadx0F6EgGmW71hug,2022-11-27T21:09:04Z,UgygVVF8Im00z8G3jpJ4AaABAg,Matthew Ferguson,dose buss,0

My point was a few decades before that (a lot of) people belived there was no way to go faster as so many had tried and failed. But obviously thats besides the main point of the discussion.

Advanced technology has almost always been seen as something with sky rocketing costs and diminishing gains. And so called ""advancement"" is extremely hard, but also inevitable.

The laws of physics has always been a hinder ever since before the bronze age, but humans tend to find a way around those laws. Although its unavoidable that they will hinder something.

Neither money nor material is a real hinder, because in time they will be worked around. Now if you ask any major company that develops anything if they will be able to improve something about the product.

I have high hopes for innovating new methods that get around the limits, and even potentially restores the previously seen gains.  But as has been seen several times before, we are hitting the wall of our current fabrication methodology and getting beyond it will be tough. Further, just because people said it and were wrong before is a fallacy that it won’t be correct this time. We are working at a fundamentally different scale, with sizes nearing those of atoms, quantum tunneling effects, and frequencies that approach communication limits across CPU dies due to the limits of light speed. As AMD themselves recently stated they are no longer seeing performance gains for many parts by shrinking feature sizes, which was a primary consideration for using chiplets so they can save money on the many parts that don’t get benefits from advanced nodes. For a long time we have been facing the prospect of dark silicon, in that energy efficiency no longer increases with smaller nodes so much of the CPU needs to remain inactive (or dark) at any given time to not set it on fire. Shrinking components has allowed us to package more complex logic in the same space, allowing more feature rich hardware which can be better optimized, but it has been a long time already since we have significantly increased the amount of logic that can be used at once (this is why multi core became a bigger thing).",Reply,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX90IoNadx0F6EgGmW71hug,UCX90IoNadx0F6EgGmW71hug,2022-11-23T23:24:45Z,UgygVVF8Im00z8G3jpJ4AaABAg,Matthew Ferguson,Gabriel Guedes Balogo,0

The fact that zen 4 is not that different from zen 3 supports my argument. They mostly improved by doubling L2 cache and numbing clocks (which is done by increasing power, which can’t physically be done indefinitely). The point is the gen on gen gains are mostly utilizing methods that can’t be indefinitely continued (and arguably is already at a limit) and so betting on massive continuous gains in a platforms life cycle is very uncertain",Reply,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX90IoNadx0F6EgGmW71hug,UCX90IoNadx0F6EgGmW71hug,2022-11-23T22:52:07Z,UgygVVF8Im00z8G3jpJ4AaABAg,Matthew Ferguson,Gabriel Guedes Balogo,1

9imgCkTHZq29imwAzeKkdE,2022-11-23T21:50:31Z,EkiToji,"@Mavis I'd generally agree but then AMD finally agreed to let older boards support Zen 3.  I splurged a little on an X370 board to get some various specs I wanted and justified it to myself because I knew I could probably upgrade my CPU at some point.  I moved up from a 1600 I bought in 2017 to a 5600 without having to buy new RAM (admittedly only DDR4-3000) or motherboard.  Because of that I actually also seriously considered and was quite close to splurging to get a 5800X3D instead and I'm sure plenty of people did for exactly that reason.  If I couldn't upgrade the way I did I probably would just have waited until next summer at a minimum and it would likely come down to something like a 7800X3D or more likely cheaping out on a cheaper motherboard and cheaper CPU with a 13500 by going back to Intel.  Or possibly just hold off on upgrading entirely which means also not upgrading the GPU, since I went a decade on a used i7 965 before trying out the new Ryzen.  Either way I think what they did with AM4 was awesome and given how expensive AM5 boards are currently that promise of longtime compatibility and an upgrade path is fairly critical.",Reply,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCONQRGDz8Bb3_2F0L2OIIA,UCCONQRGDz8Bb3_2F0L2OIIA,2022-11-23T21:50:31Z,UgygVVF8Im00z8G3jpJ4AaABAg,Matthew Ferguson,Mavis,0

Are you getting your math correctly?

10€/$ per week are 480€ per year on Strom/ electricity for the *difference* alone!

Now a real case: 

- choosing AMD you should save 50€ on the price + 100€/ year on electricity. More if you consider heat dissipation. 

- choosing AMD gives you 3 years of upgrade flexibility (new gen and 3D options or even longer), usually by Intel or  doesn't ""last"" as long.

So on the long run going AMD for the CPU and eventually AMD for the GPU will give you fantastic gaming results while not spending near as much.

I'm no fanboy and don't care about the brand, but it's a lot of money. For the average lifespans my PC's have (5-8 years), that's a lot of years on power. Also, the current price for power in my country is like €0,8 right now, which is almost double that of Germany, apparently, making Germany a very non-extreme example.

But even if it wasn't, it's still quite a lot of money. I pay so little on my power bill (like 20 bucks a month total)  because of my choices and if I have a setback, I can still keep using my more expensive investment (pc) without worrying about its power usage. Also, saving on power, means more saving for other fun stuff I'd like to buy.

9imfVPekx7d9imt2TIsBZe,2022-11-23T21:23:09Z,Jordan,"@Unknowniti I certainly am not. A extreme example is Germany at 0.457 $/kWh. 13900k at full load is ~140 w above 7950x. So even if you are running at full bore 24/7 that’s only ~$10.74 per week. Even for gaming that not extreme (a lot of people spend much more on hobbies like a single movie/drink). And don’t forget this is a extreme example for one of the most expensive places and running at max power 100% of time. More so, I especially called out productivity in such cases of you are making money from it. $10.74 a week is surely worth it if it gives even a 1-2% increase in work throughput. Of course know your workload and don’t use a more power hungry cpu if it doesn’t give any benefit. But people have to keep these numbers in perspective. Every company is going to try to get people talking about their advantage, even if that advantage is not realistically a good metric to evaluate on for most. FYI in a place like the US and  reasonable work day of ~12 hours this equation brings it down to just $1.58 per week, and can even heat up your room if placed well and living in a cold place",Reply,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX90IoNadx0F6EgGmW71hug,UCX90IoNadx0F6EgGmW71hug,2022-11-23T21:23:09Z,UgzcncWBFuz7nG-gmi14AaABAg,Anders Struck,Unknowniti,30

It'll likely be the same story as the RTX 3000 series vs the RX 6000 series. Pretty close across the board with lower power draw and much better price to performance for AMD, but for the absolutely highest performance (and power draw!) NVIDIA remains on top, even more so when it comes to raytracing. This time around people (even the bigger NVIDIA fans) actually seem to (finally) be fed up with NVIDIA's insane pricing which is interesting as AMD seems to be planning on gaining marketshare (whilst still charging too much, but not as much as NVIDIA) instead of going for completely insane prices.

Interesting times, I'll just stand on the side-line and see if there's any used market deals because I'm not going along with this crazy pricing scheme that's been happening ever since the RTX 2000 series on both sides.",Reply,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgJrfbGXGwoZmlPHa7iuSEw,UCgJrfbGXGwoZmlPHa7iuSEw,2022-11-24T12:50:49Z,UgzHiTWEEqorDCaLjdx4AaABAg,TheXGamer,Gaston Zamora,2

The best cost-effective solution today is a Intel CPU with a AMD GPU (assuming the 7900XTX outperforms the 4080), RTX XX90 aren't even cost efficient to be considered.

HOWEVER due to how developers simple choose to give a better support to NVIDIA technology (even when consoles uses AMD GPUs) you will be missing a lot of features in some games like DLSS and DLAA, even with FSR as alternatives, some games don't even include FSR, and DLAA replaces TAA as being the best visual-performance AA solution.

As for production... it all depends of which technology do you rely on, but for gaming and streaming, either one will sufice.

All in all, it comes down to what the buyer wants to do with the GPU itself.

And about the CPUs, they forgot to take one little detail into consideration, and thats upgrade path, AMD is known to make their platforms last many generations, while Intel changes the platform every other generation. Meaning that 14th gen will be in a new platform, while 8th 9th and 10th gen will still be AM5 for AMD (if things go as expected). So in the long run, AMD is the more logical option for someone that expects to possibly upgrade in the future. But, we are talking flagship CPUs, both 13900k and 7950X will be incredible CPUs 2-3 years from now anyways.",Reply,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXsfjEfbIm6uPcPI4HBoLBg,UCXsfjEfbIm6uPcPI4HBoLBg,2022-11-23T19:52:17Z,UgzHiTWEEqorDCaLjdx4AaABAg,TheXGamer,dylan neff,37

The worst part is that these high end motherboard designs STILL sandwich hot m.2 drives between a searing hot GPU and the motherboard. Situated in such a way there will be little to no direct airflow, but that's not all... it will also be impossible to install better heatsinks on the m.2 drive because there is no vertical space to do it. They're going to have to work up a way to provide airflow and increase the level of cooling. Perhaps they will move drives to the back of the motherboard again and implement some sort of ducting?

Memory bandwidth is probably the most significant in that regard, as pretty much every APU will be memory bottlenecked since it has to fight the cpu for every bit of bandwidth there is. How much it will be bottlenecked depends on the game or application you're running, but it's not necessarily related to the API. Drivers are another variable: an APU will probably get game optimized drivers, while I'd imagine an NVS probably gets workstation optimized drivers. Different architectures can absolutely perform differently on various APIs even when the gpus are generally similar in performance, but I'd say you really have to look for a more apples to apples comparison to know for sure. Ideally you'd want them to have a very similar memory configuration as well (both having very similar bandwidth and either the same amount of vRAM, or making sure none of the games you're testing exceed the vRAM limitation of the card with less vRAM)",Reply,http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCetzS-KtUt_Ch2EzN385KDw,UCetzS-KtUt_Ch2EzN385KDw,2022-11-23T20:01:42Z,UgyRTQj7MlsYGDdoBQ54AaABAg,Retro Skaff,,2
